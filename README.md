# ssdnodes-ansible-provision

A basic Ansible playbook to provision bare servers with SSH keys, iptables, and fail2ban.

This playbook was created in conjunction with two forthcoming blog posts on the [SSD Nodes blog](http://blog.ssdnodes.com/blog), which will be published on August 31 and September 7. I'll update this README with links as they become available.

This playbook was built as an educational tool for the SSD Nodes blog. It **is not an officially supported tool**, and comes with no support other than these instructions and any discussions that might be found in the [repository issues](https://github.com/joelhans/ssdnodes-ansible-provision/issues).

Instructions forthcomingâ€”basic instructions can be found within [provision.yml](https://github.com/joelhans/ssdnodes-ansible-provision/blob/master/provision.yml).
